# SpringBoot to-do-list manager
 A simple to-do-list manager to work with SpringBoot and ReactJS end to end. The project features a H2 in-memory database and two basic controllers for CRUD operations. On the front-end I used ReactJS together with MaterialUI for some nice and fancy looking components, as well as Axios to make fetching data easy and fast. To run the application I start the Spring Boot back-end from IntelliJ, and run the React client from Visual Studio Code.
