# SpringBoot to-do-list manager
A simple to-do-list manager to work with SpringBoot and ReactJS end to end. The project features a H2 in-memory database and two basic controllers for CRUD operations. On the front-end I used ReactJS together with MaterialUI for some nice and fancy looking components, as well as Axios to make fetching data easy and fast. To run the application you can start the Spring Boot back-end from IntelliJ, and run the React client from Visual Studio Code. Alternatively there is a docker-compose.yml file at the root so docker-compose up should also be able to start the application.
